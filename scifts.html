                The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) is an international organization, founded in 1939 as a
                non-profit
                society. With over 23,000 members, the organization involves those working and studying food science,
                technology, nutrition, and related topics in industry, academia and government.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                The Southern California Institute of Food Technologists (SCIFTS) is one of the largest sections of IFT.
                SCIFTS puts on local networking events and talks of topical interest, funds student scholarships, and
                helps
                advance the science of food in Southern California.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I was a member of SCIFTS for some time, having studied and practiced Food Science for a number of years.
                I
                continue to have an interest in the food industry and have a desire to see SCIFTS offer the best
                informational resources it can.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Revitalizing the SCIFTS website allows me the opportunity to combine my past in Food Science with my

            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Members of SCIFTS use the website for many purposes. The site is used to gain information on
                organization meetings, guest speakers, and other events, as well as to post advertisements for food
                company sponsors and provide
                contact information for SCIFTS board members.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">The main target population for the site is SCIFTS members
                (including board and committee members) and prospective members. However, it is also used by anyone else
                who is seeking information about the organization so they can hold an event, become a
                sponsor, advertise, etc.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-subtitle">
                Competitive Landscape
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                There is no true competitive landscape as SCIFTS is the only IFT organization in California. This is the
                one digital
                platform SCIFTS currently uses as its official website to connect its members and it doesn’t truly
                compete with similar organizations.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                That being said, there are similar non-profit organizations, such as
                NCIFT (Northern California Institute of Food Technologists) or IFST (Institute of Food Science and
                Technology). Exploring a competitive analysis on these similar organizations could still yield
                beneficial insights.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-subtitle">
                Identifying the Problem
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Not long ago, I visited the SCIFTS website and noticed it looked pretty dated. Having studied web
                technologies and design in recent years, I saw the site with new eyes. Looking a bit “dated” is one
                thing, but I wanted to see if the site could be revitalized by a design revamp.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Further analysis concluded that the SCIFTS website could definitely benefit from research and
                improvement. In
                addition to looking very outdated, the site had other real problems. There are multiple links throughout
                the site that simply don’t work (i.e. nothing happens when you click them). A lot of links just look
                like normal text - they have no indication they are even links until you hover over them.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                The site’s photos are fuzzy, stretched out, or have poor resolution. The sponsors’ logos are of
                particularly low resolution, which is not the representation I imagine these sponsors would think is
                ideal. The overall site’s current logo could use a graphical update/alteration. The site is also missing
                certain modern conventions described in Jakob Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics, such as Visibility of
                System Status. For example, when you click on a navigation bar’s link and goes to a new page, the link
                shows no indication of which page you are now on. I noticed the animated advertisers’ logos worked on
                Chrome, but did not work on Firefox.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Finally, I discovered that the site does not have a separate experience for mobile, leading users to try
                to read very small fonts. Mobile is truly a requirement in this day and age for any legitimate
                organization that wants to be taken seriously. While designing a mobile version is indeed important and
                acknowledged, this particular project will focus on the desktop version.

                As can be seen from the above figures, there are many aspects to fixing the problems of the current
                platform. Links should be given new
                aesthetics and buttons will be added to denote exactly what the user can do to get to new locations.
                New, higher resolution images should be added to enhance the emotional response and improve food company
                advertisements.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                All these problems will be addressed to improve the user experience. With
                research and
                testing, even more issues and their corresponding solutions are discovered.

                The first big step in solving the problems of the current SCIFTS website was to interview those using
                the current system. Understanding the experience of users who are familiar with the SCIFTS website, as
                well as those new to the site, is crucial to developing the most useful redesign.

                There were a few ways to recruit participants for researching users’ needs of the SCIFTS website. I
                reached out to former Food Science classmates and colleagues who are current members of SCIFTS. I also
                reached out to SCIFTS board and committee members. This was accomplished through my current contacts,
                emails found on the website, and Facebook. I found it was also beneficial to test with non-members as
                they have different perspectives.

                result. She goes to the website and signs up for SCIFTS membership on the “membership” tab. Clicking on
                the “job posting” link in the navigation bar, she searches for local jobs and fills out a few job
                applications. She later gets an email for a networking event for SCIFTS members.

                Sandra makes a great in-person connection, and the food scientist is impressed, now putting a face to
                the applicant. Sandra’s use of the SCIFTS website made it possible to make new job-related connections.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Brian has been looking for additional ways to connect with other flavor chemists and discuss business
                ethics. He has been hearing about competitors making flavors for vaping, a relatively new segment in the
                nicotine industry. Brian likes the idea of providing a safer alternative to smoking, but knows that the
                FDA-approved chemicals he uses in food products are not approved for heating and inhaling, as one would
                do in vaping. Brian has been a member of SCIFT for years, enjoying connecting with other local industry
                colleagues.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Brian explores the different events coming up and decides to reach out to SCIFTS about running a topic
                for a SCIFTS event. Finding the “contact” link on the navigation bar, Brian reaches out to the email
                provided and requests to have a talk on the safety of flavor and vaping. SCIFTS agrees and the event is
                scheduled for a couple months away. At the end of the event, after Brian has said his part, multiple
                colleagues come up to him and express their gratitude for the information, saying they will consider
                ceasing vape flavor production at their facility.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                On a subsequent visit to the SCIFTS website, Brian notices the “sponsors” link on the navigation bar and
                visits the page. He sees other companies, including other local flavor houses,
                are advertising on the page. Brian contacts SCIFTS, requesting to be a sponsor. Brian’s use of
                the SCIFTS website made it possible to share his flavor and health expertise with the community and also
                help sponsor SCIFTS, providing Brian’s company with advertising on the SCIFTS website.

                Current Website’s Primary Goal
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                The website’s primary goal is to fulfill the SCIFTS mission statement: “to fulfill human needs for a
                quality food supply through science, technology and education.” In other words, the SCIFTS website needs
                to provide information to its members, sponsors, and guests about:
                <br>
                - meetings
                <br>
                - events (calendar)
                <br>
                - membership requirements
                <br>
                - provide information on sponsors and their contact info (along with a company logo)
                <br>
                - who the board members are and how to contact them

                Current User Practice
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Since there is a live SCIFTS website, the current practice for SCIFTS members is to use that. Users are
                somewhat able to find information they need, but not efficiently. Problems with links and unintuitive
                information architecture lead users to not find what they need in a timely manner or at all.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                If users can’t accomplish what they want, sometimes they visit other resources such as ift.com (SCIFTS’s
                parent organization). There they can find additional features such as job postings, information on
                different food science divisions, and food science news.

                <br>
                - membership requirements: have a page dedicated to paying dues and go through the signup process
                <br>
                - provide information on sponsors and their contact info (along with a company logo)
                <br>
                - who the board members are and how to contact them: have a list with helpful details
                <br>
                - provide SCIFTS direct contact information as well as social media links
                <br>
                - need description of membership benefits
                <br>
                - bigger and more consistent font sizes
                <br>
                - calendar section should look like a calendar

                <br>
                - redundancy: no need to have a bunch of the same things on each page (header, navigation, and footer
                are exceptions)

                - poor resolution and awkward graphics (images, logos)

            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                As previously discussed, there aren’t any true competitors for SCIFTS because it’s the only
                IFT sub-organization in Southern California. However, it is
                still beneficial to compare with parallel organizations to gain insight. The most directly relevant
                organization is NCIFT, the Northern California Section of the Institute of Technologists. Below, the
                SCIFTS and the NCIFT websites’ information architecture is compared and analyzed.

                <br>
                - Home (often seen as redundant as there should be a SCIFTS logo at the top which would do the same
                thing)
                <br>
                - About
                <br>
                - Advertising (maybe change to sponsors?)
                <br>
                - Calendar (construct to look more like an actual calendar)
                <br>
                - Member Login (is this necessary?)

                - Membership
                <br>
                - Photos (should be removed - can be added back in if someone actually has photos to add, necessitating
                this page)
                <br>
                - SCFIC

                Summary
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I liked the idea of adding a contact page to the links. Having the executive committee (and any board
                members, etc.) contacts on its own, separate page is a good idea. SCIFTS’s current site has these on the
                About page, which isn’t particularly intuitive.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">NCIFT didn’t appear to have any social media links (at
                least that I could find), which I thought was surprising, but in general, their website looks
                professional and current. There’s a header at the top with a navigation bar underneath. The content is
                below that and has a footer at the bottom. It seems to follow all major modern conventions.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I thought the aesthetics could be a bit more lively as it has lots of grey. The colors don’t seem to
                have a ton of
                cohesion: orange, a somewhat dark blue, and olive green. That said, overall, I thought NCIFT to be a
                great reference, and I referred to it throughout the design process.

                The purpose of this test was to find pain points in the user experience for the revised SCIFTS website
                designs. This test featured participants performing tasks, reflecting some of the activities users would
                want to accomplish when visiting the website. These tasks were determined based on the earlier
                interviews, which informed the needs of the website. Tasks completed involved signing up to be a member,
                finding out the address of the Golf Tournament event, obtaining the email for the person in charge of
                SCIFTS social media, finding a website URL for a flavor-producing sponsor company, obtaining the phone
                number for a company for a food scientist job position, finding how much grant money was provided for

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I sought out participants by reaching out to people I knew had used to the current, live website and had
                an interest in wanting to see it improved. I knew it was important to have participants who already use
                the website to reveal if anything in expected, normal use was missing or caused efficiency of use
                problems. I also reached out to someone who has a Master of Library and Information Science. This
                participant was intended as a third party who wasn’t influenced by previous use of the current site.
                This participant’s background in information science provided valuable feedback.

                minimal system status feedback.

                user-friendly the system. All scores were much higher than the system’s average of 68. One user reviewed
                the site with a perfect score of 100.

                A participant was unaware of the modern convention that clicking on a header’s logo will take them to
                the homepage. As including a “home” link on the navigation bar has widely been accepted as unnecessary,
                other options will be explored.

                One solution would be to make the entire header area take you to the homepage rather than just clicking
                on the logo as I noticed a user tried to click the header, expecting it to do what only a logo would
                normally do. This as a possibility because there are no other links in the header that would conflict
                with this. On the other hand, it’s possible that the user would be more inclined to click the logo on a
                higher-fidelity prototype. The wireframe’s logo looked like a circle with an “x” in it to represent an
                image, so it’s understandable that some participants may not recognize it as a logo.

                A participant noted that the “click here to purchase [the SCIFTS newsletter] subscription online” link

            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                A feature of the events calendar is when a user clicks on an event, more detailed information is
                displayed, including an address for the event location. A participant recommended adding a google map
                image link, so the user would be able to quickly see the address in relation to a larger area the user
                is more familiar with. Then can then better plan their trip. Another request from a participant was to
                change the name of the button on the About page from “Visit IFT to become a member” to “Sign up for
                SCIFTS & IFT Membership.” This makes it more clear that visiting the IFT website is where signing up for
                SCIFTS takes place. Another participant wondered if the site might benefit from a search bar. I took
                this into consideration and performed more research on the subject. This is discussed later in this
                report.

                One limitation is the number of participants for the usability test. Typical tests require anywhere
                from five to ten participants, sometimes more. This test had only a few participants. That said,
                participants came from a variety of backgrounds and provided a picture of the general sentiment of using
                the site and actionable change recommendations.
                <br><br>
                Another limitation is that feedback from the system was not included with this prototype (which page the user is on was not yet
                indicated in the navigation bar. This was added in later versions.
                <br><br>
                Finally, some buttons were hard to locate because the wireframes are in black and white only and they didn’t
                stand out as well as they will when color is added.

                Participants were able to easily navigate through the website and find what they needed in nearly every
                task. The problems needing changes were updated in the next prototype version, and font, color, and
                layout changes were applied.

            </h2>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Moving forward from wireframes to a medium-fidelity mockup, there are some design goals I kept in mind.
                I wanted the spirit of the original website to come through in the sense that the organization is
                Southern California-based. I used pictures I found from free stock image websites such as Unsplash. The
                buttons are a light blue color, representing the ocean and sunny skies. The other main color used was
                green,
                representing organic material.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">Something that I changed from the current website was to make more of an
                emphasis on a food aesthetic. There are several photos and graphic designs of food used throughout the
                website. For the logo, I used the original IFT logo and put blue S’s and C’s around it to complete the
                “SCIFTS” logo and and emphasize the Southern California section of IFT. I used a lot of whitespace for
                the background to give the site a simple, clean, and
                uncluttered feel.

                implemented. Once the next mockup iteration was ready, I performed a UX heuristic analysis on the
                designs based on Jakob Nielsen’s “10 general principles for interaction design.” The below findings
                indicate heuristics that were violated and recommendations on how to fix them for the next iteration

                to be displayed. Users would expect a website to display details of an event, so there is a violation
                between the system and what is expected.

                The purpose of this test was to find out if there were new or additional pain points in the user
                experience for the higher-fidelity SCIFTS website prototype since design became more detailed. Ideally,
                things should become clearer and easier to navigate with the addition of more detailed visual design. It
                is possible, however, that some things could become more complicated on screen. This usability test
                would help determine if improvements had been made since the last test. Some tasks were revised and some
                were added to be more thorough. Like the first usability test, the tasks reflect activities users would
                want to accomplish when utilizing the website. These tasks were determined based on the earlier
                interviews, which informed the needs of the website.

                This round of usability testing showed users were easily able to complete the tasks and find whatever
                information they needed. The tasks were completed even faster than in the first usability test. This
                makes sense as some of the problems in the original test were caused by not having distinguishing
                colors, fonts, and images to help users stay informed of where they were on the site, what constitutes a
                button, etc. The issues found in this test were relatively minor and most were due to subjective
                aesthetic preferences.

                The SUS (System Usability Scale) questionnaire showed the participants found the website to be very
                user-friendly. The scale is scored 0 to 100. The higher the score, the more user-friendly the system is
                ranked by the test participants. Like the first usability test, all scores were higher than the system’s
                average of 68. One user reviewed the site with a perfect score of 100 and multiple participants
                scored the website above 90.

            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                It took some extra time for some users to complete task #6, which was locating the email for the person
                in charge of SCIFTS LinkedIn. This is probably due to the member roles not really having an intuitive
                order. A simple adjustment of switching to alphabetical order would fix this issue.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I had a couple users wonder if a search bar might be a helpful tool for the site. I can understand
                having this feature on a website with hundreds or thousands of articles, but on a website with nine
                pages, including the home page, it seems unnecessary. The tasks were accomplished so quickly that it
                reflects users being able to find what they need without a search bar.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                When people use a search bar, it needs to display results they were looking for. If it doesn’t actually
                show what they searched for, they are generally more frustrated than if there’s no search bar in the
                first place. If the SCIFTS site becomes much bigger, with lots more content, a search bar could
                potentially be implemented.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                One way to help alleviate the need for a search bar is to have alternate ways to get where you want to
                go. If someone clicks a link on the navbar and it doesn’t take them directly to the content they
                intended, there’s a link on the page they went to which should get them there. For example, if you are
                trying to sign up for membership, one might think to click the Members page link. That page is actually
                about existing members, but there is also a link right at the top of the content of that page that will
                take users to the About page, where member sign up information is actually located.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Multiple users felt the Jobs page aesthetics were a bit whimsical. Muting the colors and removing the
                shadow should make them appear more professional.

                Limitations
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                One limitation, similar to the first usability test, was the number of users for the usability test.
                While this test did have several participants, some tests have ten or more, yielding more detailed
                results.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Participants were able to easily navigate through the website and find what they needed in each task.
                The few, minor problems needing changes were updated for the final version of this project.

                Next Steps
            </h2>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                While the designs for the new SCIFTS website are fairly detailed, there is always room for improvement.
                Even if these designs get developed and turned into a functioning website, the work is never done. Post
                launch, more testing could be performed in the form of A/B testing or Preference testing. Also, updating
                the website with new events and other content will always be required. Without even doing more testing,
                there are aspects of the site designs that could use additional refining.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Some of the actual content itself could be reworded. Jakob Nielsen’s principles for interaction design
                describe “Aesthetic and Minimalist Design” as, “Dialogues should not contain information which is
                irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant
                units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.” Following this guideline, I think some
                content could probably be reduced, leading to people actually reading more content.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                One page that the current SCIFTS site has featured on the navigation bar that my site doesn’t is the
                SCFIC (Southern California Food Industry Conference) page. I felt a whole additional page based on one
                event may not be necessary. It could simply be added as an event on the events calendar.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Content that could be added would be additional information on membership benefits.
                While there is some information on the IFT website, more information on the SCIFTS website itself could
                be beneficial.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Finally, the most obvious and important next step would be implementing a responsive version of the
                site. The current site accessible on a phone or tablet is just a smaller version of the desktop site and
                has no separate designs (font is tiny, layout is poor for smaller screens). I designed for desktop as a
                priority because users I interviewed said they typically accessed the site through desktop or laptop
                computers. However, it’s important for all modern websites to have responsive designs. Designs for
                mobile (or other sizes) could be implemented in the future, but it’s beyond the scope of this project.
