                The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) is an international organization, founded in 1939 as a
                non-profit
                society. With over 23,000 members, the organization involves those working and studying food science,
                technology, nutrition, and similar topics in industry, academia and government.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                The Southern California Institute of Food Technologists (SCIFTS) is one of the largest sections of IFT.
                SCIFTS puts on local networking events and talks of topical interest, funds student scholarships, and
                helps
                advance the science of food in Southern California.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I was a member of SCIFTS for some time, having studied and practiced Food Science for a number of years.
                I
                continue to have an interest in the food industry and have a desire to see SCIFTS offer the best
                informational resources it can.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Revitalizing the SCIFTS website allows me the opportunity to combine my past in Food Science with my

            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Members of SCIFTS use the website for many purposes. The site is used to gain information on
                organization meetings, other events, and guest speakers, as well as advertise food companies and provide
                contact information for SCIFTS board members.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">The main target population for the site is SCIFTS members
                (including board and committee members) and prospective members. However, it is also used by anyone else
                who is seeking to find out information about the organization so they can hold an event, become a
                sponsor, advertise, etc.

            <h3 class="project-subtitle">
                Competitive Landscape
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                There is no true competitive landscape as SCIFTS is a non-profit organization. This is the one digital
                platform SCIFTS currently uses as its official website to connect its members and it doesn’t truly
                compete with similar organizations.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                That being said, there are similar non-profit organizations, such as
                NCIFT (Northern California Institute of Food Technologists) or IFST (Institute of Food Science and
                Technology). Exploring a competitive analysis on these similar organizations could still yield
                beneficial insights.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-subtitle">
                Identifying the Problem
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Not long ago, I visited the SCIFTS website and noticed it looked pretty dated. Having studied web
                technologies and design in more recent years, I saw the site with new eyes Looking a bit “dated” is one
                thing, but I wanted to see if the site was truly worth a design revamp.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Further analysis concluded that the SCIFTS website is indeed worthy of research and improvement. In
                addition to looking very outdated, the site had other real problems. There are multiple links throughout
                the site that simply don’t work (i.e. nothing happens when you click them). A lot of links just look
                like normal text - they have no indication they are even links until you hover over them.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                The site’s photos are fuzzy, stretched out, or have poor resolution. The sponsors’ logos are of
                particularly low resolution, which is not the representation I imagine these sponsors would think is
                ideal. The overall site’s current logo could use a graphical update/alteration. The site is also missing
                certain modern conventions described in Jakob Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics, such as Visibility of
                System Status. For example, when you click on a navigation bar’s link and goes to a new page, the link
                shows no indication of which page you are now on. I noticed the animated advertisers’ logos worked on
                Chrome, but did not work on Firefox.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Finally, I discovered that the site does not have a separate experience for mobile, leading users to try
                to read very small fonts. Mobile is truly a requirement in this day and age for any legitimate
                organization that wants to be taken seriously. While designing a mobile version is indeed important and
                acknowledged, this particular project will focus on the desktop version.

                As can be seen from the above figures, there are many aspects to fixing the problems of the current
                platform. Links should be given new
                aesthetics and buttons will be added to denote exactly what the user can do to get to new locations.
                New, higher resolution images should be added to improve the emotional response and improve food company
                advertising.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                All these problems will be addressed to improve the user experience. With
                research and
                testing, even more issues and their corresponding solutions are discovered.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                The first big step in solving the problems of the current SCIFTS website was to interview those using
                the current system. Seeing how SCIFTS website users (and non-users) experience the website and finding
                things they need, and like or dislike about the system is crucial to developing the most useful
                redesign.

                - Determine the biggest pain points for users of the current system
                <br>
                - Determine if there are additional features or requirements that could be beneficial to the platform

                Recruiting Criteria
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                There were a few ways to recruit participants for researching users’ needs of the SCIFTS website. I
                reached out to former Food Science classmates and colleagues who are current members of SCIFTS. I also
                reached out to SCIFTS board and committee members. This was accomplished through my current contacts,
                emails found on the website, and Facebook. I found it was also beneficial to test with non-members as
                they have different perspectives.

                Current Website’s Primary Goal
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                The website’s primary goal is to fulfil the SCIFTS mission statement: “to fulfill human needs for a
                quality food supply through science, technology and education.” In other words, the SCIFTS website needs
                to provide information to its members, sponsors, and guests about:
                <br>
                - meetings
                <br>
                - events (calendar)
                <br>
                - membership requirements
                <br>
                - provide information on sponsors and their contact info (along with a company logo)
                <br>
                - who the board members are and how to contact them
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-subtitle">
                Current User Practice
            </h3>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Since there is a live SCIFTS website, the current practice for SCIFTS members is to use that. Users are
                somewhat able to find information they need, but not efficiently. Problems with links and unintuitive
                information architecture lead users to not find what they need in a timely manner or at all.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                If users can’t accomplish what they want, sometimes they visit other resources such as ift.com (SCIFTS’s
                parent organization). There they can find additional features such as job postings, information on
                different food science divisions, and food science news.
